# AirBnB Project for UCI Datathon 2024

Data representing the AirBnB market in Dublin was provided to us by the Datathon organizers. 

In this repository, you'll see a finalML jupyter notebook which represents a portion of the 
data pre-processing and use of predictive models with the scikit-learn package in Python. 

Descriptive statistics and other pre-processing work couldn't be uploaded for some reason, 
but I've included a presentation that demonstrates the outcome of that work below
